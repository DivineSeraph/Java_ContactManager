# Java_ContactManager
A command line interface contact manager that stores the contact list in a .ser (Serialized object data file) and implements exception handling. 
The .ser file is created in the project source directly itself.
The project is implemented using the new standards of file operations i.e.,using file stream and object stream.
The data in the file remains in the file and is not extracted in its entirety when operations are performed on the data like updating a contact or searching through all contacts. These operations are performed by applying file operations.
